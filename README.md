With the advent of computers and their ability to manipulate a huge amount of data, a database
as a means to collect, organize and store data to draw useful conclusions has been the backbone
of modern-day computation. Database management systems have developed a huge amount to
meet the demands and increasing complexity of databases. In this project, we aim to present our
understanding of Database Management System by implementing it to create a database system
for municipality. The database will store all the details of the citizens living under the
municipality area, projects controlled by the municipality, employees working at the
municipality office and other such details. Many government offices have not been digitalized
despite being in the twenty first century. This model is a proof of concept for implementing a
robust system even in the remote parts of the country.
Our project is the full-fledged website implementation of Municipality Management System
which digitalizes the municipality system and ensures reliable, faster and efficient municipality
services to the concerned users.
